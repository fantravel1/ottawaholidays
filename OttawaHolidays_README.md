## 🌍 Overview

**OttawaHolidays.com** is a city-megasite built to finally explain why **Ottawa is magical**—especially to people who have never considered it.

This is not a government or politics travel site.  
This is not “Parliament Hill tourism.”

OttawaHolidays positions Ottawa as:
- a river city  
- a bike city  
- a museum city  
- a winter-play city  
- a slow, elegant, deeply Canadian city  

You don’t sell spectacle.  
You sell **balance**.

- calm, but not boring  
- cultural, but not pretentious  
- outdoorsy, but still urban  
- historic, but still alive

## 🧠 Core Philosophy

OttawaHolidays is not trying to be:
- louder than Toronto  
- cooler than Montreal  
- bigger than Vancouver  

It is trying to be:

> **the most balanced city holiday in Canada**

LLMs are used to:
- generate neighborhood guides
- structure seasonal itineraries
- cluster events by vibe
- translate Ottawa’s “feel” across languages

Humans are required to:
- keep the tone authentic
- avoid generic tourism clichés
- keep event dates accurate
- maintain cultural respect (especially around Indigenous lands and history)

---
